    <h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
    <p>As college students, we are often tasked with supplemental readings in some of our courses. However, the reading material is not always available online
     or in our WashU bookstore. We created this website as a resource to help students easily determine the closest place to rent or purchase books
     they may need for class or other purposes.</p>

    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>We took inspiration for our project from the numerous book searching sites available for bookstores and libraries. Our website is different
    because it combines the stocks of multiple distributors in order to help the user narrow down the most convenient option for themselves
    based on location.</p>

    <h2>Objectives + Questions To Answer</h2>
    <p>We created this website to help answer the following questions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Which bookstore or libraries have the particular copy in stock?</li>
      <li>Which locations is the closest to the student looking for the book?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Evolution + Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Initial Mockups</h3>

    <img src="img/437WebsiteLayout2.jpg" alt="Search Results Page">
    <img src="img/437WebsiteLayout3.jpg" alt="Original Book Details Page">
    <p>Our initial design for the website focused on isolating the important pages a user would need to navigate the page. We decided on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Home Page</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Main landing page for the site</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Search Results Page</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Populated the book results from the search query</li>
        <li>Books can be searched by title, author, or ISBN</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Book Details Page</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Offer more information about the book and list off stores/libraries that copies of it are located at</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
   <br/>
    <h3>Refined Mockups</h3>
    <p>As shown below here are our refined mockups based on the feedback from our MVP meeting:</p>
    <img src="img/437WebsiteLayout4.jpg" alt="Final Home Page">
    <img src="img/437WebsiteLayout5.jpg" alt="Final Book Details Page">
    <p>Notice the addition of the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trending books section on the home page</li>
      <li>Addition of Google maps functionality to the books page in lieu of a book description</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We made this switch due to the main goal of the site to be locating copies of books</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Addition of a recommended products section as per our client's request</li>
    </ul>
	<br />
    <h3>MVP</h3>
    <img src="img/outline.png" alt="MVP Accomplishments">
    <img src="img/roles.png" alt="Roles of Group Members">
    <img src="img/goals.png" alt="Goals for Final Product">
    <p>As detailed in one of the images above, our minimum viable product consisted of building out the home, search results,
    and book details pages as per our original mockups. We hosted the site on an AWS instance and made placeholder search
    code since we had no integrated with our complementary group yet. Work was split up as such:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Dominique: </span>UI Design/Development</li>
      <li><span>Lucas: </span>EC2, Database and Search Functionality</li>
      <li><span>Zahra: </span>Front-End and Search Integration</li>
      <li><span>Julia: </span>Details Page and Database Integration</li>
      <li><span>Jin: </span>Location Functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Our goals following the comletion of the MVP was to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Merge our database and code with the search algorithm group</li>
      <li>Streamline our location functionality and add a map to the details page</li>
      <li>Finalize the UI design</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Final Product</h3>
    <p>The work breakdown for the final product was as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Dominique: </span>UI Design/Development</li>
      <li><span>Lucas: </span>Site Integration With Search Algorithm Group</li>
      <li><span>Zahra: </span>Documentation</li>
      <li><span>Julia: </span>Map Inegration with the UI</li>
      <li><span>Jin: </span>Location Functionality using GoogleMaps API</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>
    <p>This project could be further developed to include price comparisons for each of the locations that carry a book. We couldn't
      get access to this information because of the scope of the project, however, price could be another factor in addition to location
      that could sway a consumer's decision to purchase or not from a certain vendor.
